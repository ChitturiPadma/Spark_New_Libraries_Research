Can we dervie Certainity from Uncertainity ? 

It's a common scenario to make connections with Database, make webservice calls to 3rd party API
especially when dealing with data processing frameworks such as Spark. The main question that araises is can we parallelize 
these executions concurrently ? As we all knew, Spark runs pieces of computation called as tasks insided JVMs (executors).
The number of tasks is limited by the number of cores that each machine holds. Each task is executed by a single thread 
which runs the serialized code synchronously. This single thread executes each record sequentially. What if for each record
some third party API call needs to be invokded or connection to DB needs to be made ? 

We can achieve concurrency in spark transformations using Futures.The level of concurrency could be unbouded awaiting the 
results endlessly which has it's own disadvantage of throwing OOM exceptions. The better way to deal with unbouded
concurrency is to incorporate Batched concurrent execution using Futures.
