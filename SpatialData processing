In today's world there has been vast amount of data being generated from mobiles/electronic devices. This data constitues
spatio-temporal aspect. The two known frameworks for large scale data processing are Hadoop and Spark. Hadoop has its

frameworks such as Spark can be leveraged for processing spatial data. There are 3 systems that implement Spatial operators 
with Spark - GeoSpark, SpatialSpark and STARK
